Instructional Concept Library
-----------------------------
This package contains topic-specific, class-aware instructional solutions.

Scope:
- Concept clarification (e.g., fractions, ratios, geometry)
- Prerequisite-aware explanations
- Grade-appropriate, offline-first teacher actions

This library is intentionally separate from:
- classroom management
- behaviour
- wellbeing
- productivity

Routing into this library is handled by the decision engine
when topic-level instructional intent is detected.
