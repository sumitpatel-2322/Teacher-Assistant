Math Instructional Concept Library
----------------------------------
Contains topic-specific instructional solutions for Mathematics.

Design principles:
- Topic-driven (fractions, ratios, geometry, etc.)
- Class-range aware (not class-specific folders)
- Prerequisite-aware (bridging weak foundations safely)
- Concrete → pictorial → abstract progression
- Offline-first, classroom-usable actions

This library does NOT include:
- Behaviour management
- General classroom control
- Teacher wellbeing or productivity solutions
